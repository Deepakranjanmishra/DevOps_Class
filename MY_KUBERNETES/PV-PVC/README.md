Why change reclaim policy of a PersistentVolume
PersistentVolumes can have various reclaim policies, including "Retain", "Recycle", and "Delete". For dynamically provisioned PersistentVolumes, the default reclaim policy is "Delete". This means that a dynamically provisioned volume is automatically deleted when a user deletes the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim. This automatic behavior might be inappropriate if the volume contains precious data. In that case, it is more appropriate to use the "Retain" policy. With the "Retain" policy, if a user deletes a PersistentVolumeClaim, the corresponding PersistentVolume will not be deleted. Instead, it is moved to the Released phase, where all of its data can be manually recovered.

Q) Can a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in one namespace bonded to a PersistentVolume (PV) in another namespace in Kubernetes ?

Namespace restrictionsMany Kubernetes resources are restricted to the namespace that they belong to. This limitation is true for PVCs, and for apps that are built based on the concept of shared resources, it poses a challenge. PersistentVolumes (PVs) that back PVCs, on the other hand, are cluster-scoped resources.

Yes, by default, a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in one namespace can be bound to a PersistentVolume (PV) in another namespace in Kubernetes. This is because:

PVs are cluster-scoped resources: PVs are visible across all namespaces in the cluster. They represent the actual storage available for Pods.
PVCs are namespace-scoped resources: PVCs define the storage requirements for Pods within a specific namespace.
However, it might not be the intended behavior and can lead to unexpected results. Here's why:

Security concerns: Sharing PVs across namespaces can introduce security risks if Pods in different namespaces shouldn't access the same data.
Accidental binding: You might accidentally bind a PVC to the wrong PV in another namespace.
Here are some recommendations for managing PVCs and PVs across namespaces:

Use namespaces appropriately: Organize your PVs and PVCs within namespaces based on their functionality to enforce isolation.
Specify both claimRef and volumeName in PVs: While optional, specifying both claimRef (referencing the desired PVC) and volumeName in the PV definition ensures the PV binds only to the intended PVC, even if there are PVCs with the same name in other namespaces.
Consider storage classes: Leverage Storage Classes to define provisioning rules and access modes for PVs, further restricting access based on namespaces.
For shared storage scenarios across namespaces with certain storage providers (like NFS with ReadWriteMany access mode), you can create multiple PVs referencing the same underlying storage and use them with separate PVCs in different namespaces. But be cautious about potential data inconsistencies when multiple Pods write to the shared storage.
