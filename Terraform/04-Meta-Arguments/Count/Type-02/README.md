In Terraform, **count.index** is a built-in variable that provides the current index of the resource being created when using the count meta-argument.

Purpose:

count.index allows you to access the current index of the resource being created, enabling dynamic configuration and customization.

Example:

```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {

  count = 3

  ami           = "ami-123456"
  
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
      Name = "Server-${count.index + 1}"  # Uses count.index to create unique names
   
  }
  
}
```

In this example:

- count = 3 creates three aws_instance resources.
- 
- count.index is used to create unique Name tags (Server-1, Server-2, Server-3).

Properties:

- count.index starts at 0.
  
- Incremented by 1 for each resource created.

- Available only within the resource block using count.

Use cases:

1. Dynamic resource naming.
2. Customizing resource properties based on index.
3. Creating resources with unique identifiers.
