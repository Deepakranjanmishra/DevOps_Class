Breakdown of the Configuration File :

This Terraform configuration file consists of two main sections:

**Provider Configuration**: This section specifies the cloud provider and the region where you want to deploy your resources. In this example, we’re using AWS as the provider and specifying the region as us-east-1.

**Resource Configuration**: This section describes the AWS resources you want to create. Here, we’re creating an EC2 instance using the aws_instance resource. We specify the AMI ID of the instance, the instance type, and any additional configurations such as tags.
