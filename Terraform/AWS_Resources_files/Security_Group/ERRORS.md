### Solution : MetaAI

This error occurs when Terraform finds multiple VPCs that match the specified configuration, and it can't determine which one to use.

Reasons for the error:

1. Multiple VPCs with the same name or tags.
2. Insufficient filtering criteria in the aws_vpc data source.
3. Missing vpc_id or vpc_name attributes.

Solutions:

*1. Specify vpc_id attribute:*


terraform
data "aws_vpc" "example" {
  **id = "vpc-12345678"**     #  I added athe vpc id to the config file  I
}


2. Use additional filtering criteria:


terraform
data "aws_vpc" "example" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["my-vpc"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Environment"
    values = ["dev"]
  }
}


*3. Specify vpc_name attribute:*


terraform
data "aws_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my-vpc"
}


*4. Use most_recent attribute:*


terraform
data "aws_vpc" "example" {
  most_recent = true
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["my-vpc"]
  }
}


Best Practices:

1. Use unique VPC names or tags.
2. Specify vpc_id or vpc_name attributes.
3. Use filtering criteria to narrow down matches.
4. Verify VPC configuration before running Terraform.
