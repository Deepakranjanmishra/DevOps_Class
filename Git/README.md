puts markdown.to_html
```

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

use the below line 
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````````````````````

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

2. Multiline Code Block
3. 
```In a multiline code block, a set of lines is formatted to a single block of code. To format multiple lines of code in Discord, enclose it within three backticks. For example, to make a code block containing "This is sample multiline code block", you need to type the following:```

#### 1. expalin the syntax -  tags = {

    Name = "${join("-", tolist([var.myname]))}-${count.index}"

    Team = "DevOps"

##### Understanding the Syntax


The provided code snippet is likely part of a configuration file or a scripting language, such as HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) or a templating language like Jinja2, often used in infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform.

Let's break down the syntax step-by-step:

1. Declaring a Dictionary:

tags = {
     ...
}



`This line declares a dictionary named tags. Dictionaries are key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. In this case, the keys are Name and Team.`

2. Defining the Name Key:

`
Name = "${join("-", tolist([var.myname]))}-${count.index}"
`


`${...}**`: This syntax indicates a template expression, where the enclosed expression will be evaluated and substituted with its result.
join("-", ...): This function takes a list of strings and joins them together using the specified delimiter, in this case, a hyphen (-).
tolist([var.myname]): This converts the variable var.myname into a list. This is likely necessary if var.myname is a string that needs to be split into individual characters or words.
-${count.index}: This concatenates a hyphen and the value of the count.index variable to the end of the joined string.
Overall, the Name value will be a string constructed by:

Splitting var.myname into a list of characters or words.
Joining these elements with hyphens.
Appending the value of count.index to the end, separated by a hyphen.
3. Defining the Team Key:

Team = "DevOps"
This simply assigns the string "DevOps" to the Team key.

Example:

If var.myname is "John_Doe" and count.index is 3, the resulting tags dictionary would be:

tags = {
    "Name": "John-Doe-3",
    "Team": "DevOps"
}


#### 2.  explain the following command elaborately - ${join("-", tolist([var.myname]))}


##### Breaking Down the Command: ${join("-", tolist([var.myname]))}`

This command, often found in configuration languages like HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) or templating languages like Jinja2, is a concise way to manipulate strings and create dynamic values. Let's dissect it step-by-step:

1. Template Expression:

${...}: This syntax denotes a template expression. It indicates that the enclosed expression will be evaluated and the result will be substituted into the final string.
2. join("-", ...) Function:

join: This function takes two arguments:
Delimiter: In this case, "-". It specifies the character to be used to separate the elements of the list.
List of Elements: The second argument should be a list of strings.
3. tolist([var.myname]) Function:

tolist: This function converts its argument into a list.
[var.myname]: This is a list containing a single element, which is the value of the variable var.myname.
Combining the Steps:

Convert to List: The var.myname variable, which is likely a string, is converted into a list of characters.
Join the List: The join function takes this list of characters and concatenates them using the hyphen (-) as the delimiter.
Example:

If  `var.myname` is "JohnDoe", the expression would be evaluated as follows:

1.  `tolist([var.myname])` would result in `["J", "o", "h", "n", "D", "o", "e"]`.

2.  `join("-", ["J", "o", "h", "n", "D", "o", "e"])` would result in `"J-o-h-n-D-o-e"`.

Common Use Cases:

Creating Unique Identifiers: This technique can be used to generate unique identifiers for resources in infrastructure as code tools like Terraform.
Formatting Strings: It can be employed to format strings in a specific way, such as separating words with hyphens or underscores.
Customizing Output: By combining this expression with other template language features, you can customize the output of your configuration files or scripts based on variables and conditions.
By understanding the components of this expression, you can effectively manipulate strings and create dynamic values in your configuration files and scripts.
